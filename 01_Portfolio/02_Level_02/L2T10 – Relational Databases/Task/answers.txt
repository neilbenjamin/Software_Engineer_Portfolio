Question 1 - What is normalization 

Normalization is a process used to analyse a table and the structure 
thereof to reduce redundancies and eliminate anomalies by restructuring the 
tables to fit with the 1NF, 2NF and 3NF methodologies or methods.

Question 2 - When is a table in NF1 state?

*   When each attribute is atomic, or, non-divisible, or where there is just 
    one attribute in each cell.
*   When there is either a singular primary attribute that defines all the 
    other non-primary attributes, know as a Primary Key or when 2 or more 
    attributes are identified as being the Primary Key on which all the other 
    attributes depend on, then the Primary Key is know as a Composite Key.
*   When there are no repeating groups in the table.
*   When all attributes are dependent on the Primary Key. 

Question 3 - When is a table in NF2 state?

*   When it is NF1 state.
*   When there is no partial dependency from a non primary attribute to a 
    primary attribute whether singular or composite, but rather to requires 
    a full dependency to the Primary Key.

Question 4 - When is a table in NF3 state?

*   When it is in NF2 state.
*   When there are no non-primary attribute dependencies on another non-primary 
    attributes. The non primary attributes need to be dependent directly on the
    Primary Key.
