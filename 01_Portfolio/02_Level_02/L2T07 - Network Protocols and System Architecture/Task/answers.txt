Question 1

A protocol is a set of standardized rules that devices follow to communicate 
and exchange data over a network.

Question 2

HTTP is built on the TCP protocol (Transmission Control Protocol). 
This is essentially the mechanism that breaks data into packets, 
routes them across the internet network, ensuring they reach the correct 
source and unpacking them again. The HTTP relies on the TCP to maintain a 
reliable connection between the client and the server. 

Question 3

200 OK

Question 4

Stateless protocol means that the requests sent to the server are not in any 
way related to previous or future requests and are 100% independent from any 
other requests. 
No server-side tracking is necessary to store the state and once the request 
has been received and the appropriate response initiated, the connection is 
terminated.
