                <h1>BIOGRAPHY </h1>
                <p>Active Event & Production Manager. Just produced a bespoke production for a private client from Germany 
                    involving 620 delegates, 52 musicians and 40 crew. I've also been involved in productions outside of 
                    South Africa, specifically in Kenya. I also manage and produce the entertainment line-up for the DJs 
                    at Sun International, Grandwest Casino & Entertainment World. I am also a Software and Web Developer 
                    and completed a Full Stack Web Development Programme in 2023 and currently busy completing a Software Engineering
                    course in 2025.<br><br>
                    I now find myself with 2 passions that take up my time, namely production and event management as well as 
                    designing and building web applications, websites and thinking of solutions for everyday problems that can be 
                    fixed with technology. 
                    I also love playing the guitar and making music and find great joy in helping younger students with their musical 
                    journeys on the instrument.<br><br>
                    In my studio work as a sound designer and post production audio engineer, I won 2 SAFTA Awards for Best 
                    Sound Design for the Television Category in 2018 & 2019, created the soundtrack, mix and final mix for 
                    the 2Ocean's documentary, Run As One as well as a myriad of other Television Productions, albums and 
                    projects. Check out www.blacksheepmusic.co.za for more info on this topic.
                    For the future, I'd like to continue my studies with software engineering and learn some more languages 
                    such as Java, pHp and Flutter to assist with application development as well as gaining a better insight into 
                    database management as well as refining talent, concept and execution for the entertainment and event 
                    industry.</p>
