* 404 page

Con's 
* Colour is possible the worst colour combo ever invented in the history of 
  of the world. 
* no Grid or Flex properties and subsequent no dynamic resizing for images 
  text. Th etext does wrap, but it's hardly dynamic. 
* No redirect for 404 or outbound link. Just a dead endpoint. 
* The colour. Again...
* The text contrast on the vomit-blue backhground makes it hard to read the 
  text with ease. 
* No menu on the home page.
* No e-commerce options, but EFT and bank details....
* The layour is not great at all. The design elements are slapped on with very 
  little attention paid to design elemenst at all eg. all the media items are
  different sizes, not dynamic, in ugly placeholders. 
* So, this website was mostly created in 1997, and never updated since. 
* No use of buttons, carousels and very little CSS.
* No contact page, even though contacts are on teh front page, but I'm used 
  to seeing a contact page.
* No contact forms.
* No POPIA or local legal compliance/consent forms. 
* No dynamics for mobile. Menu is so small it's almosty unuseable. 
* NO attention paid to Font or type face matching or best practises for SEO 
  and search engone indexing options.
* No native mobile application. Browser based mobile website. Not the same. 
* Outdated and old. Doesn't inspire anything.

  all the assets, which make it very easy to access anything. 
* Focussed mobile design with mobile headers, menues, footers and elements 
  specific to monbile. 
* Typeface elements are complimentary and creative fontface useage with the 
  correct header and font-sizes utilised for SEO crawl and indexing purposes.

* Fresh and modern. Inviting.
