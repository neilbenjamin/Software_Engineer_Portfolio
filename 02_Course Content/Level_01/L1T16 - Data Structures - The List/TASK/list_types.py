"""L1T16 - Data Structures - The List - Task 1"""

# Resubmission - Corrected the previous friends_ages list and only included
# their ages. 

# Create list

# Alex = Age 51, Andy = Age 49 & Kat = Age 49
friends_names = ["Alex", "Andy", "Kat"]

# Print elements in list according to list index

print(friends_names[0])
print(friends_names[2])
print(len(friends_names))

# New variable associating the correct age to each name index in the 
# friends_names list. I've read teh instruction multiple times and it seems 
# that this is literally what it's asking me to do. Here is the extract from
# the pdf: "Now, define a list called friends_ages that stores the age of each 
# of your friends in a corresponding manner, i.e., the first entry of this list 
# is the age of the friend named first in the other list. Not sure if I've 
# misread the instruction again and if I have, please advise so I can correct
# it.

# Alex = Age 51, Andy = Age 49 & Kat = Age 49
friends_ages = [51, 49, 49]
